1.If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?:

Very danceability(0,71), sufficient energy(0,66), and moderate valence(0,48)


2.Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?:

If we make a calculation on how many songs he has in the library and start from this, then this may not show the correct result.
The listener may no longer listen to the songs that he has added to the library and may skip them.
It is better to be based on how many times a person listened to the same song in a certain period (week, month) and make a calculation on more listened songs.
